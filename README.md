## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a ~~twenty~~ thirty something computer science student and [software engineer](https://www.fhv.at/studium/technik/informatik-bsc). 

Back in the day, I used to be a pokemon trainer with several years of experience in Kanto and Johto.

Nowadays I spend the vast majority of my time inside [GNU/Emacs](https://emacs.org).

Oh and btw I'm using Arch Linux (but also try to get into some BSD).

The window manager of my choice is: [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org)
