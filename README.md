## Hi there 👋

- I'm a ~~twenty~~ thirty something computer science student and [software engineer](https://www.fhv.at/studium/technik/informatik-bsc)
- Back in the day, I used to be a Pokémon trainer in Kanto and Johto
- Nowadays I spend the vast majority of my time inside [GNU/Emacs](https://emacs.org)
- The window manager of my choice is: [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org)
- I like listening to Phil Collins and Genesis 🎵 
- I must have been a squirrel 🐿️ in my prev' life as I'm very much into data hoarding
